This project includes two interfaces: AccountServiceInterface and PersistenceInterface.
Your task is to create the implementation for these interfaces, according to the JavaDoc.
We expect you to also write unit tests and we value clean code. You can add any library you want.
If anything is unclear, make your own decision. Just as you would in your daily work.
